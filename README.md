# Matchstick Solver

A package for solving matchstick equation puzzles.

## What are Matchstick Equations?

Matchstick equations are puzzles where you have an equation represented by matchsticks, and you need to move a certain number of matchsticks to make the equation valid.

For example, given the incorrect equation `1+1=3`, you could move one matchstick from the `3` to make `1+1=2`, which is correct.

## Installation

```bash
npm install matchstick-solver
```

```javascript
// ESM import
import MatchstickSolver from 'matchstick-solver';

// CommonJS require

const solver = new MatchstickSolver('1+2=4', 1);
const solutions = solver.solve();
console.log(solutions);
